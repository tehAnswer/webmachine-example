# WebMachine Example

This repository contains a stupid RESTful API with 3 resources built on top [WebMachine](https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine-ruby/) which is a HTTP abstraction-layer.

# How to run

Once in the root directory of this project, execute `bin/server`.
The application uses sqlite as the main database, so there is not need to start anything besides the server.
